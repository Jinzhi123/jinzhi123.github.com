I was an Eyes High postdoctoral fellow in the Haskayne School of Business, University of Calgary, Canada. During my postdoc, I work closely with [Alberta Health Services](https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/) and emergency departments in Calgary.

He is particularly interested in applications that arise from healthcare operations, such as emergency response management in the aftermath of mass-casualty events and patient flow management in hospital emergency departments.
