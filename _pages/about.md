I am an Assistant Professor of Management Sciences in the [College of Business](https://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/), [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/).

I got my bachelor degree in Industrial Engineering from Tsinghua University, an M.Sc. and a Ph.D. in Statistics and Operations Research from the [University of North Carolina Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/). I was an Eyes High postdoctoral fellow in the Haskayne School of Business, University of Calgary, Canada. During my postdoc, I work closely with Alberta Health Services and emergency departments in Calgary.

My research interests are within the area of modeling, analysis, and control of stochastic systems. He is particularly interested in applications that arise from healthcare operations, such as emergency response management in the aftermath of mass-casualty events and patient flow management in hospital emergency departments.
