This is an elective course for the taught master program MSc. in _Quantitative Analysis for Business_. This course aims to teach students the theory and applications of quality control, especially in the service industry. Basic statistical knowledge is required to take this course.

May 20, 2020: I will teaching this course in Sem A of 2020-2021. I am trying to reshape the structure of this course, as I am not entirely happy about its current design.
