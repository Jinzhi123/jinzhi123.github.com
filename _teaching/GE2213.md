This undergraduate course is part of CityU's initiative [_Gateway Education_](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/edge/ge/). This course aims to equip students with a good understanding of the concept of uncertainty to help them become informed decision-makers and critical consumers of statistical information in their future professional lives.

## Student Achievement

I taught this course for two years, 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. Each year, we have one group of students winning the Award of Outstanding Academic Papers by Students.
