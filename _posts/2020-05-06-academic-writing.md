This is some random notes for myself on academic writing and $\LaTeX$.


### Hyphens, Em Dashes, and En Dashes (see [Here](https://zhanksun.github.io/posts/en-dashes-em-dashes/))

The latex commands are:
* Hyphen: -
* En-dash: \textendash
* Em-dash: \textemdash

### Math spacing

Math spacing from smallest to greatest: \,, \\:, \;, \quad, \qquad


### Miscellany
  1. Other disease researchers said the findings of Dr. Vespignani’s team were **broadly in line with** their own analyses.
  2. In New York, for example, the model shows that the first 10 infected people could have been walking the streets of the city **as early as the last week in January, or as late as the middle of February**.
  3. A single sub clinical case with R0 of two will reach 500 in a week, 15,000 by week 2 in populated areas. Then **it fans out like wildfire to suburban, rural areas**.
  4. At the end of February, the Yale President **convened a group of public health and medical experts to advise university decision-making and provide public health guidance to the Yale Community**.
  5. He **took particular aim at what he called the “misleading” media for sowing division**. “I believe in free press. **I don’t mind opinionated press. I do, however, reject inaccurate or deliberately misleading press**,” he said in a statement.
  6. But the episode also **revealed some of the strange dynamics at play in the coronavirus era, at the intersection where health policy, geopolitics and international commerce meet**.
  7. Of course, things didn’t **shake out that way. The best laid plans and all that**.


### Capitalization in Titles: Which Words??

  Headings, chapter titles, book titles, movie titles……these titles all require proper capitalization. Which words are capitalized in a title, anyway? Or, which words are not?

  Here are some rules to help you:

  1. The first and last words of a title are always capitalized, no matter what they are.

  2. The articles a, and, and the are not capitalized unless they are the first or last words of a title.

  3. The conjunctions for, and, nor, but, or, yet, or so are not capitalized unless they are the first or last words of a title. However, sometimes for, yet, and so can be other parts of speech. For can also be a preposition, but you don’t have to worry about that because little prepositions are not capitalized either! However, yet and so can also be adverbs, and adverbs are capitalized in a title. Here are some examples of yet and so:

  I am so tired. (So is an adverb.)

  I am tired, so I will take a nap. (So is a conjunction here; it is connecting two clauses.)

  Are we there yet? (Yet is an adverb here.)

  I am tired, yet I can’t sleep. (Yet is a conjunction here, a connecting word.)

  You probably won’t have to worry about yet and so too much in titles. My guess is usually they will be adverbs in a title, unless your title is really long. So capitalize them.

  4. Small prepositions of four or fewer letters (with four letters you have a choice of whether or not to capitalize) are not capitalized.

  Common short prepositions: to, for, by, in, out, up, down, at, with, past, over.

  Common longer prepositions (capitalize these): above, below, beyond, between, among, along, beneath, under.

  NOTE: Although in is a preposition, if and it and is are NOT! These words need to be capitalized! If is a conjunction, it is a pronoun, and is is a verb.

  Here are some titles that are capitalized correctly:

  Tender Is the Night

  Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner?

  Joy to the World

  Somewhere over the Rainbow (or Over)

  Woe Is I

  The Best Little Grammar Book Ever!

  Correct Me If I’m Wrong

  Algebra Is Tough, yet Fun!

  I that last title, yet is used as a conjunction, or connecting word, so it isn’t capitalized. It looks kind of funny to me. If all words except one in a longish title are capitalized, and it looks odd to you, you can capitalize all the words. In a title, ’tis better to capitalize a word when in doubt, than not capitalize one that should be capitalized.

  Special Note: Is, Are, Was, Were, Be: These words are all verbs and thus very important and always capitalized in  a title. If you don’t capitalize these, the grammar police will be out looking for you!
