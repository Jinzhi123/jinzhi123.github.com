This is some random notes for myself on $\LaTeX$.

### Hyphens, Em Dashes, and En Dashes (see [Here](https://zhanksun.github.io/posts/en-dashes-em-dashes/))

The latex commands are:
* Hyphen: -
* En-dash: \textendash
* Em-dash: \textemdash

### Math spacing

Math spacing from smallest to greatest: \,, \\:, \;, \quad, \qquad
