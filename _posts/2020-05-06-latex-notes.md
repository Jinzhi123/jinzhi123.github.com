This is some random notes for myself on $\LaTeX$

### The Hyphen

The hyphen is the shortest of the three marks, and we use it most commonly to combine words (making compounds such as “well-being” and “advanced-level,” for example) and to separate numbers that are not inclusive (in phone numbers and Social Security numbers, for example). Correct hyphenation is often a complicated issue. However, our focus is on the two kinds of dashes.

### The Em Dash

When we hear the term dash, most of us picture the em dash. It is significantly longer than the hyphen. We use the em dash to create a strong break in the structure of a sentence. We can use these dashes in pairs, as we would use parentheses—that is, to enclose a word, or a phrase, or a clause (as we’ve done here)---or they can be used alone to detach one end of a sentence from its main body.

Dashes are particularly useful in a sentence that is long and complex or in one that contains a number of commas, as in this example:

* We bought markers, paper, pens, and tablets—all of which were on sale, of course—for our clients to use in the courtroom.

If we confuse the em dash with the hyphen, we make a sentence virtually impossible to read. If we had used a hyphen in place of each dash two sentences ago, it would seem as though we had hyphenated two pairs of words in the sentence: "tablets-all" and "course-for," neither of which makes any sense.
