Inspired by self-replicating 3D printers and innovative agricultural and husbandry products, we study optimal production and sales policies for a manufacturer of self-replicating innovative goods with a focus on the unique "make-or-sell" trade-off, namely whether a newly produced unit should be sold to satisfy demand and stimulate future demand or added to inventory to increase production capacity. We adopt the continuous-time optimal control framework and marry a self-replication model on the production side to the canonical innovation diffusion model on the demand side. By analyzing the model, we identify Strong and Weak Replicability regimes wherein production and sales respectively take priority over the other, and fully characterize their distinct optimal policies. These insights prove highly robust in several model extensions, including backlogged demand, repeated purchases, and additional exogenous and endogenous production constraints. We also numerically show that the policies perform quite well under uncertainty and can be adapted to accommodate online learning.
